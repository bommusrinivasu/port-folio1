At the end of the lesson, will have a portfolio page added to their website. The portfolio page will list all of the projects we'll complete in our studies, and help begin a decent resume of your coding skills! In this lesson, we also delve a bit deeper into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and hyperlinks.

#Take Away

Building a web page from scratch Basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Basic web page navigation through hyperlinks, aka anchor tags Relative vs absolute file paths Using git and GitHub

#Work Flow

We're going to continue building out your website by adding a portfolio page where you can show off bueaty of nature . We'll also spruce up the site by further developing the design with CSS.

In this project.I displayed the different images of nature with their corresponding text and also the links.
These links will navigate into the wikipedia webpage when user clicks the link.
